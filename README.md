# Unbound
This is a prototype of the game Unbound.
Unbound is a 2D "shoot 'em up" type game. 
The games mechanics will be based around four main characters with different abilities, as well as each characters movement mechanic. 

The game will feature tons of loot: weapons, shields, and helper minions with some collectible items.

The story is based in a different world controlled through oppression and mind control. 

Here is a screenshot of the latest build with rough sprites.
