# Unbound
This is a prototype of the game Unbound.
Unbound is a 2D "shoot 'em up" type game. The game will give the user precise control using a 2D raycast based movement system made from scratch. The gun controls are based on a point and click system, where the weapons will shoot wherever the mouse is pointed.

Here is a screenshot of the latest build with rough sprites.
